Welcome!
    This is my augmented reality project for Foundations of the Restoration. Each different marker will provide the user
with additional educational content about BYU's campus. It works by pointing your phone camera at marker that looks like
this:

For extra fun, go to each building listed on the markers and look at the additional content while you are in front of the
buildings and objects specified on the markers. There are videos, so headphones may be required to watch without disturbing
the general populous. 

Enjoy!
